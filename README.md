# üñ•Ô∏è image-post-processing
HDR, Histogram, Sharpen, Gamma correction, Bloom, Blur, Contour detection
#### **Problem what I'm trying to solve:**
> - Gray scale algorithms.
> - Blur algorithms.
> - Sharpen algorithms.
> - Bloom
> - Contour detection
> - Gamma correction (RAW to sRGB)
> - HDR(Dynamic Range Compression)
> - Noise Reduction
> - Histogram viewer, Interactive tools

## Install:
`image-post-processing` has an automatic installer.
Copy the line bellow to your console and execute it.
It will automatically download the repo, create the necessary folders.

```
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/jeekpark/image-post-processing/main/install.sh)"
```

## Execute:
Run the command below.
```
cd ./image-post-processing
```
```
./imagepp <file.jpg>
```

## Features:

> ### Black & white convert
> #### Average method
> Calculates the average of the Red, Green, and Blue (RGB) values of each pixel.<br>
> #### Weighted or luminosity method
> Human eyes are more sensitive to green. So diffrent weights are appilied to the RGB values.<br>
```(0.299 * red) + (0.587 * green) + (0.114 * blue)```<br>
> #### Desaturation method
> This method takes the average of the maximum and minimum values among the RGB components of each pixel.<br>
> #### Single color channel
> This method simply uses one color channel (such as Red or Green) for the black and white conversion.<br>
> #### Comparison of Four Types
> Luminosity method is the best.<br>
